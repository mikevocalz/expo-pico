PICO-only permissions and features no longer reach the Quest and mobile APKs. `com.picovr.payment.BILLING` (iap, subscription), `com.picovr.platform.permission.SOCIAL` (rooms, social) and the spatial `pico.software.*` features used to be written to the main AndroidManifest, which every flavor merges. They now go to the pico (and dual) flavor manifest through core's new `withPicoFlavorPermission` / `withPicoFlavorFeature` helpers, and a re-run of prebuild removes copies an older prebuild left in main. Apps with `buildVariant: 'mobile'` have no pico flavor and keep the entries in main. These packages now need `@expo-pico/core` 1.1.0 or newer.
